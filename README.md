# GTFO.EZ

A BepInEx IL2CPP plugin for GTFO that tunes health, regen, stamina, fall damage, ammo, and enemy
detection for an easier co-op run, with 530+ further config values exposed underneath for players
who want to go deeper.

Try it: install from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/gtfo/p/MindAttic/GtfoEZ/) (listed
there as `GtfoEZ`, since package names can't contain a period).

## Why

- Play GTFO's existing rundowns without a full difficulty rewrite - this patches fields on the
  game's own loaded datablocks at load time instead of shipping replacement JSON, so it keeps
  working across patches that only rebalance base values.
- Defaults are tuned against other long-running GTFO easy-mode mods' settled-on numbers, not one
  person's guess, so a fresh group can drop in without an hour of config tuning first.
- Nothing is hidden: every tunable value, curated or not, lands in the config file BepInEx writes
  on first launch, so a group can push further (or less) without anyone recompiling.
- Upgrades don't silently undo a player's own choices: BepInEx normally freezes whatever's already
  in a `.cfg`, so this mod runs a one-time, per-setting migration whenever a *default* changes,
  instead of leaving upgraders stuck on a stale number forever.

## Features

**Core tuning** (community-consensus defaults; see `package/README.md` for the full
vanilla-vs-default table):

- Health, regen rate and regen cap, stamina (removes the in-combat penalty), fall damage amount
  and max-damage height, weapon/tool ammo, and enemy movement-detection range.
- Every consumable found in boxes, lockers or lying around is a health, tool or ammo kit holding
  20-40% of a pack; the zone's normal resource packs still spawn as usual. Turn off `Consumables
  Are Kits` (Loot) for vanilla consumables, where glow sticks, lock melters, C-foam, trip mines
  and fog repellers are disabled by default. With GTFO.AbsurdWeapons installed, its loot
  settings take precedence: kits at its odds and size, plus Hand Grenades.
- Fog: the fog's own enabled flag is switched off, and since fog still showed in play, a silent
  fog-clearing sphere (the Fog Repeller's, minus its light, sound and time limit) follows you,
  widening from 4 m to 25 m over 90 s each level. Tunable under `Fog Clearing`.
- Revive duration is cut roughly two-thirds.
- Sentry guns place and pick back up instantly - the vanilla hold-to-confirm charge is removed by
  default. Placing your own switches you straight back to the weapon you had out before.
- **Dash**: hold Shift and double-tap W/A/S/D for a quick 6 m dash that way, mainly to
  sidestep homing projectiles. It moves you through the game's own character
  controller, so walls stop it; 1.5 s cooldown. Tunable under the `Dash` config section.
- **Artifact buffs**: each artifact you pick up buffs you for the rest of the level - Bold +5% max
  health, Aggressive +5% damage, Muted 5% harder to detect. Tunable under `Artifacts`.
- On first launch only, switches on four of the game's own control options (toggle comms menu,
  toggle sprint, toggle aim, stand on jump) - a one-time nudge, not an enforced setting.

**Everything else** - 530+ further config entries covering flashlights, movement speed, friendly
fire, battery drain, no-air damage, per-enemy health/damage, the full per-difficulty-tier
`ExpeditionBalanceDataBlock` (loot budgets, enemy caps, level generation, doors), every melee
weapon, and every ranged weapon archetype plus sentries - all left at vanilla by default. See
`package/README.md` for the complete breakdown, including real in-game weapon names.

**Experimental** (`Experimental` config section; see Limitations below):

- **Bot tool controls** (on by default): aim your own sentry's placement ghost and press
  **Shift+E** to drop the next bot's equipped tool there instead of yours; **Z**
  instantly recalls every bot-placed tool back into its bot; **X** places your own sentry without
  pulling it out.
- **Ping Anywhere** (on by default): `PING <KEY>` from any terminal reaches an item anywhere in
  the level, not just the terminal's own zone. Same-zone pings are left to the game's own PING.

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| E (aiming your sentry) | Place your own sentry - instant, then back to your previous weapon |
| Shift+E (aiming your sentry) | Place the next bot's tool at your aim instead |
| Z | Recall every bot-placed tool at once |
| X | Place your own sentry without pulling it out (at your aim if holding it, else just ahead of you) |
| Hold Shift + double-tap W/A/S/D | Dash that way |

## Quick start

Requires the [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) and `BepInExPack_GTFO` already installed
and launched at least once ("Modded" start) in a Thunderstore Mod Manager or r2modman profile.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/mindattic/GTFO.EZ.git
cd GTFO.EZ
.\build.ps1
```

This builds against the Thunderstore Mod Manager profile named "Easy Mode DEV" by default
(`.\build.ps1 -Profile MyProfile` to use another one), places the plugin straight into that
profile's `BepInEx/plugins/GTFO.EZ/` folder so you can launch the game and test immediately, and
also produces `dist/GTFO.EZ-<version>.zip` for sharing. A successful load shows "GTFO.EZ vN
Active..." on the rundown-select screen and again as a warden-intel message in-level.

If you're on the older r2modman app instead, its profiles live under a different path - point the
build at it directly:

```powershell
dotnet build .\src\GTFO.EZ\GTFO.EZ.csproj -p:BepInEx="$env:AppData\r2modmanPlus-local\GTFO\profiles\Default\BepInEx"
```

## How it works

```text
GameDataInit.Initialize (game boot)
        |
        v
  GameDataTweaks postfix patch
        |
        +--> ApplyPlayerTweaks / ApplyFallDamageTweaks / ApplyAmmoTweaks / ...
        |      (each of the 9 tweak categories runs in its own try/catch -
        |       one broken category logs and skips, the rest still apply)
        v
  multiplies fields directly on the game's own loaded datablocks
  (PlayerDataBlock, FogSettingsDataBlock, ExpeditionBalanceDataBlock, ...)
```

No datablock JSON is shipped or copied. Everything is a multiplier (or toggle) applied in memory
once, at load time, read from the BepInEx config. Additional Harmony patches cover behaviour that
isn't a simple datablock field: one-time control
defaults (`ControlDefaultsPatch`), revive speed, bot sentry equipping, instant sentry placement
(`SentryInstantPlacementPatch`), the dash (`DashPatch`), the experimental bot tool controls
(`DeployPickupHotkeys`), Ping Anywhere (`TerminalPingPatch`), and artifact buffs (`ArtifactBuffs`).

## Configuration

All tweaks are multipliers or toggles, tunable after first launch in
`BepInEx/config/MindAttic.GTFO.EZ.cfg` - no rebuild needed to retune a value. Config sections
mirror the feature groups above: Health, Stamina, Fall Damage, Ammo, Lighting, Enemy Detection,
Movement, Combat, Utility, Environment, Enemy Balance, Loot, Interactions, Consumables, Controls,
Bots, Expedition Resources/Enemies/Level Gen/Doors, one section per melee weapon and per weapon
type/archetype, Sentries, Dash, Fog Clearing, Artifacts, and Experimental.

BepInEx keeps whatever value is already in a player's `.cfg`, so when this mod changes a *default*
between versions, an existing install won't pick up the new number on its own -
`Plugin.ApplyConfigDefaultMigrations` applies the one-time, per-setting correction instead of
leaving upgraders silently stuck on a stale default (see `package/CHANGELOG.md` for the version
each migration was introduced in).

## Testing

```powershell
dotnet test tests\GTFO.EZ.Core.Tests\GTFO.EZ.Core.Tests.csproj
```

No game install or BepInEx profile needed - `GTFO.EZ.Core` holds the plugin's pure balance data and
math (weapon/melee config-table generation, the `WeaponMult`/`MeleeMult`/`ScaleInt` multiplier and
rounding logic, config-key validation) with no BepInEx/Il2Cpp dependency, so it's unit tested
directly with NUnit. The datablock patches themselves (`src/GTFO.EZ/Patches/`) can't be unit
tested - they only run against the game's own loaded data - so verify those by launching the game
after `build.ps1`.

## Project layout

```text
src/GTFO.EZ/          the plugin project (BepInEx/Il2Cpp - needs the game installed to build)
src/GTFO.EZ.Core/     pure balance data/math the plugin uses, with no BepInEx/Il2Cpp dependency -
                      split out so it's unit-testable; ships alongside GTFO.EZ.dll at runtime
tests/                GTFO.EZ.Core.Tests - NUnit, runs with plain `dotnet test`, no game needed
package/              exactly what ships to Thunderstore / gets zipped for sharing
  manifest.json       Thunderstore package name is "GtfoEZ" (no period allowed there)
  README.md           becomes the Thunderstore page - full vanilla-vs-default tables and changelog
  CHANGELOG.md
  icon.png            256x256, resized from reference/logo-1254x1254.png
reference/            (gitignored) local-only: EasyMode's files, vanilla data dumps, notes
build.ps1             builds the plugin and packages dist/GTFO.EZ-<version>.zip
```

## Versioning

v1, v2, v3... - major-only bumps, matching the convention across other MindAttic projects.
Thunderstore requires `manifest.json`'s `version_number` to be strict `x.y.z`, so "v1" is `1.0.0`,
"v2" is `2.0.0`, and so on (minor/patch stay 0). `package/CHANGELOG.md` headers use the short `vN`
form; the manifest keeps the `N.0.0` form Thunderstore requires. Current release: v14.

## Sharing with friends

- **Private:** Import the zip from `dist/` as a local mod in your mod manager, then
  `Settings -> Profile -> Export profile as code` and send friends the code.
- **Public:** Published on Thunderstore at https://thunderstore.io/c/gtfo/p/MindAttic/GtfoEZ/.
  Everyone in a lobby needs the identical mod and config.

## Limitations

- Ping Anywhere is compiled but not yet confirmed in play. An earlier attempt broke the terminal
  by letting the game also evaluate the PING it had already handled; this version owns the
  command fully (BetterTerminal's approach) and falls back to the game's PING on any error.
- The bot tool controls call the bot AI's own placement/pickup methods directly (vanilla has no
  "deploy now" order). Shift+E, X (which does nothing on a spot the game wouldn't allow) and Z
  are confirmed working in play; the weapon switch-back after placing your own is not yet.
- The dash is compiled and built on the same movement approach as GTFO.AbsurdWeapons' Katana
  dash, but not yet confirmed in play.
- Artifact buffs are compiled but not yet confirmed in play. Muted scales the game's per-player
  detection modifier (`PlayerAgent.GetDetectionMod`); whether enemies consult it for ordinary
  movement noise is the part to check.
- Fog clearing is compiled but not yet confirmed in play; its density is read from the vanilla
  Fog Repeller prefab at runtime (logged), with a Density Override if that doesn't clear fog.
- Datablock patches can only be verified by launching the game; they have no automated test
  coverage (see Testing above).
