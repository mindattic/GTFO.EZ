# Changelog

## v5

- **Bug fix:** Remove Combat Stamina Penalty previously equalized a pair of fields that are both
  0 at vanilla regardless of combat state, so it did nothing. It now correctly equalizes the real
  penalty (0.15/s vs 0.25/s regen while resting) and removes the 90% stamina cap while in combat.
- Fall damage amount is now actually cut to 10% of normal, on top of the unchanged no-damage
  height (previously only the height was touched, not the damage itself).
- Exposed more stats as config options, all left at vanilla by default unless noted: enemy max
  health, enemy melee/tentacle attack damage, consumable spawn rate per zone, big pickup spawn
  rate per zone, revive duration, 8 more individual consumable spawn-odds stats, the full
  per-difficulty-tier `ExpeditionBalanceDataBlock` (~40 stats covering resources, enemies, level
  generation, and doors), and every melee weapon stat (76 entries: 4 weapons x 19 stats each,
  organized by weapon then by action type).
- Glow Stick spawn odds now default to disabled (0) instead of vanilla — a real tuned default,
  not just exposed.
- Corrected several "vanilla" values in the docs that were placeholders or incomplete: revive
  duration (4s), flashlight angle/intensity (vary by light type, not a flat x1), and enemy
  detection distance (there's a second, 20m sleeper profile alongside the 8m normal one).
- Trimmed two config descriptions (Health Regen Cap Multiplier, Weapon Ammo Multiplier) that
  exceeded the in-game config editor's 200-character limit and were getting cut off.
- Pre-release cleanup: removed a leftover debug log line that fired on every revive, consolidated
  a redundant double-iteration over the consumable loot table, and brought both READMEs and the
  manifest description up to date with everything above.

## v4

- In-level warden-intel confirmation message now shows 90 seconds after spawn instead of 30, so
  it lands once you're actually in the level rather than right at the drop-in.

## v3

- Flashlight angle/intensity tweak now defaults to vanilla (x1.0) instead of x1.25 — vanilla
  flashlights were already fine as-is — but the config option is still there to retune if you want.
- Exposed more stats as config options, all left at vanilla by default: walk/run/air/crouch/ladder
  move speed, jump height, friendly fire damage, battery capacity and drain rate (small/medium/
  large tools), and no-air (suffocation) damage rate and depletion time.
- The in-game confirmation message now includes the mod's major version (e.g. "GTFO.EZ v3
  Active...").

## v2

- Added an in-game confirmation message: a line on the rundown-select screen, and a warden-intel
  message 30 seconds after you spawn into a level.

## v1

- Initial release: health, regen, stamina, fall damage, ammo, flashlight, and enemy detection
  tweaks, all config-driven multipliers applied at game-data load time.
